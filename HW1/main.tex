\prob{1}{
In classes that you took earlier, you met problems that were difficult or impossible to solve analytically.
Suggest at least three problems that are interesting for solving with a computer.
Describe physics and \textbf{ALL} detailed equations needed to solve these problems.
Please be as specific as needed.
Later we may use these problems for midterm projects.

\prob{2}{
Prepare your computer for the class with a language of your choice.
Most likely it will be one of these: C/C++, Python, or MatLab. (You can use more than one if you want.)
Briefly describe software that you are using

\prob{3}{

Write a program to solve the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ by using the quadratic formula to obtain roots:
\begin{align}
    x_{\pm} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c}}{2a}
.\end{align}
Your program should also be capable to handle complex roots.
Note that you don't have to use complex variables, but you may.
Choose you way to input $a$, $b$, and $c$.

\prob{4}{

Write a profram that calculates a series of Fibonacci numbers and checks which ones are prime numbers.
Explore what is the largest Fibonacci number you may get with your code.
